#Overview</br>
The movie recommendation system project is an application designed to provide personalized
movie recommendations to users based on their viewing history and preferences. The system
uses machine learning algorithms to analyse user data and generate recommendations that
match their interests. The project is implemented using a collaborative filtering approach,
which involves comparing the user's viewing history with that of other users to identify movies
that are likely to be of interest. The system also uses content-based filtering, which analyses
the features of each movie to recommend similar movies to users. The system is user-friendly,
and users can easily navigate the interface to search for movies, view their ratings, and leave
feedback.
